## Blackjack Background Info
Blackjack is a card game that goes to the score of 21. There are usually several 
players and a dealer. The players don't play against one another, but instead each
player competes with the dealer. Whole point of game is to beat the dealer and there
are couple ways you can do that
1. Getting a blackjack (An 'Ace' with either 'King', 'Queen', 'Jack', 'Ten')
2. Having the dealer go over 21 in which the dealer busts
3. Having a higher score than the dealer, but not yourself going over 21
