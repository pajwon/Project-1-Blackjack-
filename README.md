# Project-1-Blackjack

## Blackjack Background Info
Blackjack is a card game that goes to the score of 21. There are usually several 
players and a dealer. The players don't play against one another, but instead each
player competes with the dealer. Whole point of game is to beat the dealer and there
are couple ways you can do that
1. Getting a blackjack (An 'Ace' with either 'King', 'Queen', 'Jack', 'Ten')
2. Having the dealer go over 21 in which the dealer busts
3. Having a higher score than the dealer, but not yourself going over 21

### Schedule of creating game 
- December 23: Chose Blackjack as the game I wanted to create for the Project.
- December 26: Worked on the wireframe of the game with pen and paper
- December 27-29: Worked on Pseudocode for the game on how the game should work.
- January 3: Began coding the game setting up HTML, CSS and Javascript files
- January 4: Set up variables, created deck, giving values to cards and shuffled deck 
  functions 
- January 5: Created who wins and comparing hands functions. Also innertext event 
  listener with a function saying what each person has and who wins.
- January 6: Created event listeners for hit and stay buttons. Got the game running 
  without any CSS. Started working on CSS and styling game. 
- January 7: CSS and cleaning up Javascript. Created 3 separate Javascript files 
  where the first one is for pseudocode, second one(version1.js) is whole code with all comments made and final one is scipt.js code where final code with minimal comments left.

## Next Steps

    - use an API 
- Hide first card of the dealer     
    - dont show until player stands
    - then show the hidden card 
- Give an actual chip count to player 
    - will gain a chip everytime player wins 
    - and loses a chip with every loss to the dealer
